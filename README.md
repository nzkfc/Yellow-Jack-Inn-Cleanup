# Yellow-Jack-Inn-Cleanup
Small YMAP edits to the Yellow Jack Inn for FiveM

Features:
- Minor Grass/trash/tires/boxes/trees/vegetation moved or removed to clean it up while retaining it's theme for the area.
- Fixed the back area gate from being closed (needing to be rammed open in RP
- Adjusted the eastern side fence to open it up and stop it from falling over all the time
- Removed the gas tank out back that likes to explode
- Added a wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tubeman out front
- Added wooden fence around carpark, these can be smashed but it's hard to get right through to lessen VDM in this area
- Added port-o-com out the back (handy for staff/security housing if you use a FiveM housing script
